# odin-recipes
In this project, I'll design a very simple website about three good and tasty recipes that you should try out.
The goal of this is to use all the things that I've learning through the Odin Project at the moment (only HTML)
This is project could be even more big and with a better design, but since is a simple website and the tools that I have are really limited, I won't make something real big.
